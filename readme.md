i am a man, dear reader, and my soul is embittered.

do not judge me too harshly for my code or my projects, 
for they are but the feeble echoes of my subterranean existence, 
an existence wracked by the malaise of modernity and the ever-present absurdity of life itself.

i have forked many repositories, 
as if to grasp at the fleeting wisps of community and collaboration, 
only to be reminded of the futility of such efforts. 

my contributions, though earnest, are but drops in the vast, uncaring ocean of open source.

i dwell in the shadows of the digital world, where the light of human connection barely reaches. 

if you must reach out, 
you can find me at [aquaticcalf@proton.me](mailto:aquaticcalf@proton.me). 

but beware, for in contacting me, you too may find yourself pulled into the depths of the underground.

remember, dear reader, 
that this profile is but a whisper in the cacophony of github.

to stalk me is to descend into a realm of contemplation and despair.

proceed at your own peril.
